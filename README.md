# Sprint Challenge: React - Star Wars

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past Sprint and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored ReactJS, Functional Components and Class Components. In your challenge for this Sprint, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating an application that uses ReactJS to consume live data retrieved from the World Wide Web and style that data nicely on the page.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency ReactJS Fundamentals and your command of the concepts and techniques in the Function Components and Class Components.

You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons and your project manager.

## Description

In this challenge, create a web page that presents a styled list of Star Wars characters. Being able to render out data to a web page is a large part of what JavaScript developers do, this challenge assesses your ability to achieve such a task.

## Self-Study/Essay Questions

Demonstrate your understanding of this Sprint's concepts by answering the following free-form questions. Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager.

- [ ] What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web. 

A: React JS is a Javascript library with the goal of making single page applications easier to build and make DOM manipulations easier from web developers and more effecient for the browser.
React JS uses something called Virtual DOM. This is a representation of what we want the real DOM in the browser to look like. This enables the developer to make changes to the Virtual DOM as they like and React will make the changes efficiently by only changing the neccasary parts.
This is opposed to the developer having to be very conscious about what they change in the DOM so the browser has to do as little as possible. React will manage this for us. 

React also allows us as developers to split the page up into components and create dynamic web pages more easily. By splitting the page into components that can be re-used and created on the fly means that pieces of the page can be written once and created as many times as we like. It also allows the page 
to be more responsive to data. By creating components from data we can very easily present the page in a format that is both user friendly but also representative of the data we are trying to display.

- [ ] What does it mean to _think_ in react? 

A: Thinking in React means to actively split up the page into components and the data and state those components may require. Thinking in React is a way for developers to synergise with the data and state of the page rather than worrying to much about the resulting HTML and CSS.
A developer who thinks in React should be able to easily split up pages into components and see where the state of those components should be held. They should also be able to understand the tree of state and where events and data should be passed around to make all components work together.

- [ ] Describe state. 

A: State is an object containing data relavent to the data components are working on and with. State is usually not used to display static data, or data used to directly to effect the component it is stored on. It is used when components should react and render changes in input and incoming data 
from external sources. One example would be the current value of an input field. It would be stored in state so that the parent component has data reflecting what is displayed and inputted in the page so that it can perform actions based on this.

- [ ] Describe props. 

A: Props are values passed into components to tell the element what and how to render itself. Props are used to contstruct components in a meaningful way. They are similar to atrributes used in HTML, but with a higher order of abstraction. One example would be passing the content of a component to render as a prop so it can populate the elements it displays. Props can also be used to provide callbacks for events so that the parent component can use it's own methods as callbacks and take control of actions performed on it's child components.

## Project Set Up

Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ] Add PM as collaborator on Github.
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of Repo (Not Lambda's by mistake!)
- [ ] Create a new Branch on the clone: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Change directories into `./starwars` (`cd starwars`) and run `yarn install` to retrieve all needed dependencies.
- [ ] Once you have installed the _node_modules_, run `yarn start or` to get your server up and running.
- [ ] With the server up and running, open Chrome and head over to `localhost:3000` and view your beautiful app. Maybe it's not _that_ pretty... _yet_, your goal is to ensure this project becomes a thing of beauty.
Follow these steps for completing your project.
- [ ] Implement the project on this Branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.

Follow these steps for completing your project:

- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge <firstName-lastName> Branch into master (student's  Repo).
- [ ] Add your Project Manager as a Reviewer on the Pull-request.
- [ ] PM then will count the HW as done by  merging the branch back into master.

Please note:

- In `App.js`'s `componentDidMount()` method we call the public Star Wars API, which stores the result in the component state.
- Here's an excerpt of that logic:

```js
componentDidMount() {
  this.getCharacters('https://swapi.co/api/people');
}

getCharacters = URL => {
  fetch(URL)
    .then(res => {
      return res.json();
    })
    .then(data => {
      this.setState({ starwarsChars: data.results });
    })
    .catch(err => {
      throw new Error(err);
    });
};
```

- At a high level, this code is a common way to automatically load data from a remote server into a component.
- View your `App` component's `state` by opening the Chrome `React Dev Tools` to peek at the data set. At this point you will know what to do from here.

Your data set will look like this:

![Star Wars state data](starwars_data.png)


## Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

- [ ] A list of Star Wars Characters rendered to the screen.
- [ ] You must have at least one list element for each star wars character in the data set.
- [ ] The list elements must all be minimally styled. (Don't rely on browser default styles.)

Required best practices:

- [ ] Consistent naming. Examples: variables, functions, classes, and files.
- [ ] Consistent spacing. Examples: line breaks, around arguments and before/after functions.
- [ ] Consistent quotation usage.
- [ ] Spell-check.
- [ ] Schedule time to review, refine and reassess your work.


It is better to submit a challenge that meets [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) than one that attempts too much and fails.

## Stretch Problems

- [ ] Build a pagination system that will allow you to load the next page of data

- Take note on the data that's coming back from the server call in our `getCharacters()`.
- console.log() the data coming back from the server.
- Notice that there are `next` `previous` fields that give you a URL.
- You have a function that will get chars called `getCharacters` you'll want to just call this function and supply it with the proper fields. You'll need to set this up on state to do this.

```js
 .then(data => {
    console.log(data); <-- Log data here to find the fields you will need.
    this.setState({ starwarsChars: data.results });
  })
```

- [ ] Build another app from scratch that looks very similar to this one. Inside of your main `App` component fetch some data in this same fashion from this url `https://dog.ceo/dog-api/#all` you'll have to follow the documentation at that website and figure out how to change up the code you've seen here in this Star Wars app in order to properly fetch the data and store it on Component State.

- Be mindful of the `fetch API` that is now built into most modern browsers [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).
- Your data coming back from Dogs should be formatted in JSON format.
